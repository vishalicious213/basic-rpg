# Basic RPG

This RPG is the focus of Module 7 (Next-Level JavaScript) from Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). It's a basic combat engine for a roleplaying game. Clicking on the attack button causes the Wizard character to attack an enemy, while the enemy does the same. Damage is calculated and applied to each character's health total. When the given character's health reaches 0, that character expires. If the Wizard expires, the game is lost. If the enemies die first, the Wizard is victorious. It's also possible for both sides to pass together.

## Customizations

- Added yellow color to health bar when health between 26-75%
